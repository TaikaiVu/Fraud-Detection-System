Fraud Transaction Detection system

Developed a system that evaluates financial transactions, analyzes fraudulent possibility, and provides actionable insights based on transaction patterns to mitigate financial risks, using React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern design.
Leveraged AWS SageMaker to train, deploy and invoke a custom machine learning model using XGBoost and Scikit-learn for fraudulent transaction detection, utilizing SageMaker's managed services for model training, hosting, and real-time predictions.
Utilized AWS DynamoDB for secure, encrypted storage of transaction data, AWS Lambda to achieve automated transaction handling, AWS WebSocket API for real-time data updates, and AWS CloudFront for fast, secure global content delivery.
